# Child-Therapist-tracking
This project implements a system for detecting and tracking therapists and children in videos using a fine-tuned YOLOv8n model and DeepSORT for multi-object tracking. The model was trained using the notebook available at [Adult-child-detection-yolov8n.ipynb](https://github.com/mangotraabhi/Projects/blob/main/Adult-child-detection-yolov8n.ipynb).
